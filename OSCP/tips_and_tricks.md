## Enumeration Strategy

### Order of Priority (Golden Rule)

**First 30 minutes on each target:**

1. **Port Scan** (Nmap, Rustscan)
   - All ports: `-p-` with `-T4` or `-T5`
   - Service detection: `-sV -sC`
   - Save output for later reference

2. **Web Application** (if port 80/443)
   - Check HTTP headers (server version, technology)
   - Analyze robots.txt, sitemap.xml
   - Screenshot homepage for report
   - Burp proxy to spider site

3. **SMB Enumeration** (port 139/445)
   - List shares: `smbclient -L \\\\$rhost -N`
   - Check null session access
   - Download files from anonymous shares
   - Run Enum4linux

4. **LDAP Enumeration** (port 389)
   - Null bind test: `ldapsearch -h $rhost -x -b "DC=..."`
   - Get domain users list
   - Check for pre-auth disabled accounts

5. **DNS** (port 53)
   - Zone transfer attempt: `dig @$rhost axfr`
   - Reverse DNS: `dig -x $rhost`
   - Subdomain enumeration

### Nmap Time Saver

```shell
# Quick scan (top 1000 ports)
nmap -Pn --top-ports 1000 -sV -sC $rhost

# Comprehensive scan (run in background)
nmap -p- -T4 -oA nmapresults $rhost &

# While waiting, enumerate web/SMB/LDAP manually
```

## Common Initial Access Vectors

### Ranking by Frequency (Based on OSCP Exam Data)

| Vector | Frequency | Time to Exploit | Tools |
| ------ | --------- | --------------- | ----- |
| Anonymous SMB/Web Share | 60% | 5-10 min | smbclient, curl |
| WordPress/CMS Vulnerability | 40% | 10-20 min | WPScan, Burp, manual |
| Weak Credentials (Default/Brute-force) | 35% | 5-15 min | Hydra, Medusa |
| Unpatched Service (CVE) | 25% | 10-30 min | Exploit-DB, Metasploit |
| LDAP Null Bind | 20% | 5-10 min | ldapsearch, Python |
| Credential in File/Share | 30% | 10-20 min | grep, manual search |
| SQL Injection | 15% | 15-30 min | SQLMap, manual |

### Initial Access Checklist

```markdown
- [ ] Check web app (WordPress, Joomla, custom app)
  - [ ] WPScan for WordPress
  - [ ] Check /admin, /login, /config paths
  - [ ] Look for file upload functionality
  
- [ ] Check SMB shares for files
  - [ ] Anonymous access?
  - [ ] Default credentials?
  - [ ] Backup files with passwords?
  
- [ ] Check LDAP
  - [ ] Null bind possible?
  - [ ] Get user list
  - [ ] Check for pre-auth disabled
  
- [ ] Check for default credentials
  - [ ] Application default creds
  - [ ] Service account passwords in config
  
- [ ] Manual code/file inspection
  - [ ] Source code in .git folder
  - [ ] Hardcoded credentials in files
  - [ ] Comment in HTML/PHP
```

## Privilege Escalation Methodology

### Privilege Escalation Kill Chain

**For Linux:**

```bash
# Step 1: Enumerate system
uname -a
lsb_release -a
cat /etc/os-release
sudo -l  # <-- ALWAYS CHECK THIS FIRST!

# Step 2: Check SUID binaries
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

# Step 3: Check cron jobs
crontab -l
cat /etc/crontab
ls -la /etc/cron.d/

# Step 4: Check kernel version
uname -r
# Search ExploitDB for kernel exploit

# Step 5: Check running processes
ps auxww

# Step 6: Search for world-writable files
find / -writable 2>/dev/null | grep -v /proc

# Step 7: Run LinPEAS
./linpeas.sh
```

**For Windows:**

```powershell
# Step 1: Enumerate privileges
whoami /priv
whoami /groups

# Step 2: Check UAC status
(Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System).EnableLUA
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin

# Step 3: Check for common privesc vectors
Get-ChildItem "C:\Users\*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-Content "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"

# Step 4: Check for stored credentials
cmdkey /list
dir "C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\"

# Step 5: Check scheduled tasks
Get-ScheduledTask | Get-ScheduledTaskInfo

# Step 6: Run winPEAS
.\winPEAS.exe

# Step 7: Check for weak service permissions
icacls "C:\Program Files\*"
```

### Quick Wins (Check These First)

**Windows:**

- Check privileges: `whoami /priv` and `whoami /groups`
- Weak file permissions: `icacls C:\path`
- Task scheduler: Look for SYSTEM-running tasks with write permissions
- Registry autologon: `reg query HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`
- AlwaysInstallElevated: `reg query HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer`

**Linux:**

- SUDO without password: `sudo -l` shows `NOPASSWD`
- SUID binaries: `/usr/bin/sudo`, `/usr/bin/find`, `/usr/bin/nmap`
- Writable /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow
- Wildcard in tar/chmod command in cron
- LD_PRELOAD or LD_LIBRARY_PATH in SUID binary

## Time Management

### 24-Hour Exam Timeline

| Time | Action | Expected |
| ---- | ------ | -------- |
| 00:00-01:00 | Setup + Initial enumeration of all targets | Identify service types |
| 01:00-02:00 | Attempt initial access (highest probability) | Get foothold on 1 machine |
| 02:00-04:00 | First privilege escalation attempt | Get SYSTEM/root on 1 machine |
| 04:00-06:00 | Second target initial access | Foothold on 2nd machine |
| 06:00-08:00 | Privilege escalation #2 | 2 machines compromised |
| 08:00-10:00 | AD set attacks OR 3rd machine | Working on hardest target |
| 10:00-12:00 | Continue hard target | May need to pivot/tunnel |
| 12:00-18:00 | Get remaining flags, prepare documentation | Have 25+ points |
| 18:00-24:00 | Final pushes, complete screenshots, write report | All documentation done |

### Scoring Strategy

#### Minimum to Pass: 70/100 Points

Option 1 (Conservative):

- 3 standalone machines (30 pts for initial + privesc each) = 90 pts
- Don't attempt AD set

Option 2 (Recommended):

- 2 standalone machines (60 pts) = 60 pts
- AD set user privilege = 10 pts
- Total = 70 pts (PASS)

Option 3 (Aggressive):

- 1 standalone full pwn (30 pts)
- AD set full pwn (40 pts) = 70 pts

**Pro Tip**: Focus on getting 2-3 complete machines rather than partial points on all 5

## Documentation & Reporting

### Screenshot Checklist (MUST HAVE)

For **each initial access & privilege escalation**, capture:

```markdown
- [ ] ifconfig/ipconfig output
- [ ] whoami/id command output
- [ ] Proof of access (can read sensitive file)
- [ ] Command used to gain access
- [ ] Any exploitation screenshots (SQLi payload, RCE input, etc.)
```

**Critical Files to Screenshot:**

- Linux: `/root/proof.txt` OR `/home/user/local.txt`
- Windows: `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\proof.txt`
- AD: `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\proof.txt` (on DC)

### Find Flag Commands

**Windows - Find proof.txt & local.txt:**
```cmd
:: Quick search in common locations
type C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\proof.txt
dir /s /b C:\Users\*local.txt 2>nul
dir /s /b C:\Users\*proof.txt 2>nul

:: Search entire drive
where /r C:\ proof.txt local.txt 2>nul

:: One-liner: find and display both
for /r C:\Users %i in (proof.txt local.txt) do @if exist "%i" echo %i && type "%i"
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users -Recurse -Include proof.txt,local.txt -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | foreach { echo $_.FullName; Get-Content $_ }
```

**Linux - Find proof.txt & local.txt:**
```shell
# Quick check common locations
cat /root/proof.txt 2>/dev/null
find /home -name local.txt 2>/dev/null -exec cat {} \;

# Search entire system
find / -name "proof.txt" -o -name "local.txt" 2>/dev/null | xargs cat 2>/dev/null
```

### Report Template Structure

```markdown
## Executive Summary (Non-Technical)
- Brief overview of findings
- Number of machines compromised
- Severity assessment

## Methodology
### Phase 1: Information Gathering
- Port scanning results
- Service identification

### Phase 2: Exploitation
- Initial access method for each target
- Commands executed
- Screenshots

### Phase 3: Privilege Escalation
- Vulnerability found
- Exploitation steps
- Proof of compromise

### Phase 4: Post-Exploitation
- Data accessed
- Persistence methods (if applicable)

## Appendix
- Full command output
- Supporting screenshots
```

### Report Writing Tips

✅ DO:

- Be specific: `used SQL injection in login form field "username"`
- Show command output: Copy/paste terminal output
- Screenshot everything proving: initial access, privilege escalation, proof.txt
- Be clear: "I executed X, received Y, therefore Z"
- Number all screenshots

❌ DON'T:

- Generic descriptions: "pentested the web application"
- Assume what worked: "checked if SUID existed" (show actual output)
- Miss screenshots: Any privesc without proof.txt screenshot = rejected
- Use pronouns: Use "The attacker" or "The tester", not "I"

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall #1: Shallow Enumeration

❌ Wrong: Run Nmap once, move to exploitation
✅ Right: Enumerate all services, check for null sessions, look in shares for files

### Pitfall #2: Skipping Credential Harvesting

❌ Wrong: Overlook credential files
✅ Right: **Always** check:

- PowerShell history: `Get-History`
- Windows vault: `cmdkey /list`
- Config files: `grep -r "password" /etc/`
- Notes/sticky notes: `C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\...`

### Pitfall #3: Wrong Exploitation Order

❌ Wrong: Spend 2 hours on hard service, miss easy SMB share
✅ Right: Try low-hanging fruit first (SMB, FTP, anonymous access)

### Pitfall #4: Not Taking Screenshots

❌ Wrong: Forget to screenshot proof.txt, can't prove compromise
✅ Right: Screenshot immediately: `whoami`, `id`, `proof.txt`

### Pitfall #5: Misunderstanding Proof Requirement

❌ Wrong: Root shell on machine, but no proof.txt
✅ Right: Must read `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\proof.txt` AND take screenshot

### Pitfall #6: Tunnel Problems

❌ Wrong: Tunnel not working, can't reach internal AD network
✅ Right: Test tunnel early: `ping 172.16.x.x` from attacker

### Pitfall #7: Time Wasted on Dead Ends

❌ Wrong: Spend 4 hours on unsolvable exploit, miss easy target
✅ Right: 30-min rule: If not making progress, switch target

## Mental Preparation

### Managing Stress During Exam

**First 2 hours (High Confidence):**

- Adrenaline is high
- Keep momentum: Don't spend too long on one thing
- Take breaks: 5 min every 30 mins

**Hour 8-16 (Doubt Creeping In):**

- This is normal
- If stuck >30 min, switch target
- Eat something substantial
- Walk around for 5 minutes

**Hour 20-24 (Finish Line Mentality):**

- Final push for missing points
- Don't start new exploits, finish what you have
- Focus on documentation
- Verify all screenshots exist

### Mindset Shifts

**When You're Stuck:**

- "What's the simplest thing I haven't tried?"
- Switch to different target for 30 min
- Run enumeration scripts you haven't checked yet
- Look for credential files you may have missed

**When You Have Low Confidence:**

- Remember: You've passed practice machines
- OSCP is about **methodology**, not perfection
- 70 points is passing (not 100)
- One machine fully compromised = at least 30 points

**When Frustrated:**

- Take 5-min break (don't think about exam)
- Hydrate and eat
- Remember why you started OSCP journey
- Focus on what you *have* accomplished

### Post-Exam

✅ **SUBMIT Report even if:**

- You only got 70 points (that's passing)
- You're not 100% confident
- Report isn't perfectly formatted

⏰ **Don't miss deadline** - 24 hours after exam ends
